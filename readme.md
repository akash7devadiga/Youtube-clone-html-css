# - CSS BOX model determines how much space an element takes and how much far an element is from other elements

# margin - space around the elements , padding - space inside the elements.

# paragraph text comes with default margin on top and bottom

# css specificity comes into picture when there are multiple duplicate property names - class name selector has more specificity than normal tag selector (class selector property style will override)

# Write clean code (don't repeat the styles for each paragraph.) instead define the property styles using the specific tag.

# used HTML entity for . tick and greater than symbol.

# text-decoration property -- underline text

# if we want to style/modify a part of text we need to use text element -- element which is insident a line of text. <strong>, <u> and <span> elements

# span element is the most generic text element that comes without default styles

# Use proper HTML structure to enhance developer experience -- <!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body></body></html>

# void elements - doesn't need closing tags e.g. link tag

# use seperate files for html and css for better code readabiltiy using the link element

# use google fonts

# object fit property - cover contain, object position - left, right, center

# css display property

# 3 types of elements

# block element - takes up the entire line - e.g. p tag

# inline block element - takes up only much space as they need to -- img and input tag

# inline element - text element - appear within line of text

# switch between block to inline-block convert paras to inline block elements

# div element - division - just a box, can contain other elements, containers, allow us to group all the elements together.

# block element like a container will take up an entire line of their container and not of their page eg p takes up the entire line of div.

# nested layout techniques - Vertical layout - items top of each other

# Horizontal layout - elements beside each other

# CSS GRID - Layout technique display: grid, grid-template-colums: colum1 width, colum2 width

# difference between inline block and grid elements - 1) There is no extra space between elements in grid unline inline block, elemenst are more vertically aligned than inline block elements and grid elements don't take up the entire space.

# If there are more elements than the no of columns defined in the grid then the extra element will be wrapped around in the seperate line/row

# 1 fr - free space take up the remaining screen space

# column-gap - to define space between columns

# row-gap - to define space between rows
