# - CSS BOX model determines how much space an element takes and how much far an element is from other elements

# margin - space around the elements , padding - space inside the elements.

# paragraph text comes with default margin on top and bottom

# css specificity comes into picture when there are multiple duplicate property names - class name selector has more specificity than normal tag selector (class selector property style will override)

# Write clean code (don't repeat the styles for each paragraph.) instead define the property styles using the specific tag.

# used HTML entity for . tick and greater than symbol.

# text-decoration property -- underline text

# if we want to style/modify a part of text we need to use text element -- element which is insident a line of text. <strong>, <u> and <span> elements

# span element is the most generic text element that comes without default styles

# Use proper HTML structure to enhance developer experience -- <!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body></body></html>

# void elements - doesn't need closing tags e.g. link tag

# use seperate files for html and css for better code readabiltiy using the link element
